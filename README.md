***Tool to manage e-books, create a local backup for articles & get statistics aimed towards improving productivity and consistency.***

I started writing articles on various Machine Learning topics as a part of my learning. To maintain consistency and organize my series-episode structure of writing, I developed an advanced medium article manager.

- Create local backups for any article along with all its media from medium.com 
 
- Aids maintaining continuity for various series, create and manage drafts, upload and your e-books and check-in how many pages read time-wise

- Get various statistics like episodes and the total time spend per day, pages read book-wise, etc.
